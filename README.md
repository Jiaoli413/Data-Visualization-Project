# US accidents in 2019

## Introduction
Although transportation brings many conveniences to people in nowadays, it also brings hidden safety risks. In many countries, traffic safety is a very serious topic. The number of casualties and property losses caused by traffic accidents are very huge each year.

Due to the above reason, I want to explore how weather conditions affect the severity of traffic accidents and how traffic accidents are distributed in the time dimension, thereby reducing the huge losses caused by traffic accidents. In addition, this project of visualisation maybe brings some benefits to relevant stakeholders including traffic department. They can take some effective measures to reduce the incidence of traffic accidents based on the result of visualisation. For example, according to the result of visualisation, they are able to know which continent has the highest proportion of traffic accidents in the US, which month is the highest incidence of accidents in the US and how weather conditions affect the severity of traffic accident. Then the government can take specific solutions for specific states.

## Description of data sources:
Tabular data: This is a car accident dataset, which covers 49 states of the United States. This accident dataset is collected from February 2016 to December 2019, and currently, there are about 3 million accident records in this dataset. But I only use the part of data that is accident happened in 2019. The data set contains many columns, such as time, wind speed, weather conditions, visibility and severity.

## User guide
We used a data set consisting of traffic accident records in the U.S. from 2016 to 2019, which covers 49 states of the United States. There are about 3.0 million accident records in it.

This app is an interactive tool that allows any user to interact with the app, and this app answers three questions in 3 pages respectively.

1. "Distribution & Trend" view page
provide three graphs to help visualize the data and answer which continent has the highest amount of traffic accidents in 2019 and which month is the highest incidence of accidents in 2019.

2. "Weather Conditions" view page
provide bar chart to analyse and answer how weather conditions affect the severity of traffic accidents.

3. "Time" view page
provide bar chart and line chart to analyse and answer how traffic accidents are distributed in the time dimension.
